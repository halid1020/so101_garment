"""A ported policy reproduces a real trained checkpoint, and trains like it.

This is the claim that decides whether moving the code cost anything, and it has
two halves. The finished 80 000-step ACT run on
``fold-short-from-flattend-tactile`` must plan exactly what it planned before --
and it must also compute the same LOSS and the same GRADIENTS, which the action
comparison cannot see: ``predict_action_chunk`` runs under ``no_grad`` in
``eval()`` mode, so dropout, ACT's VAE sampling and diffusion's noise draw are
all on a branch it never enters.

What this still does not cover is everything ``lerobot-train`` assembles around
the model -- processors, optimiser preset, dataloader, plugin discovery. That is
``tool/compare_port_training.py``, which runs the real trainer twice; the source
half of the argument is ``test/unit/test_policy_ports.py``.

Needs the weights on this machine and a couple of minutes of CPU, which is why
it is here and not in the unit tier. Both tests skip rather than fail when the
checkpoint is not on this machine.
