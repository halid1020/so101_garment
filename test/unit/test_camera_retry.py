"""Unit tests for how a camera stream retries, and when it stops retrying.

The behaviour under test is what turned a bandwidth-starved camera into an
endless ``read failed (N so far); reopening`` loop that hammered the USB bus the
other cameras were sharing: the first retry is free (a bumped cable must not cost
half a second of episode), everything after it backs off, and a stream that has
NEVER delivered a frame is eventually given up on rather than retried for ever.
