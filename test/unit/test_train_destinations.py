"""Where a training run may be sent, and the commands that would send it.

No machine is contacted here. What is worth testing about a destination is what
can be got wrong while writing one down -- a path that would run a second
command on the far end, a Slurm entry with no partition, a ``~`` that must NOT
be expanded on this machine -- and what an operator should be told when a box
does not answer. All of that is decided before any connection exists.

The shipped ``src/conf/train_destinations.yaml`` is checked too: it is a
tracked file that every launch reads, so a typo in it is a broken rig, not a
broken test.
