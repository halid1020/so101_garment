"""How much of a tactile frame is sensor, and how much is the light leaking in.

The crop fraction the cropped policies train at has to come from the data. This
measures the border rather than guessing at it, and prints the numbers the
choice rests on so the choice can be argued with.

    venv/bin/python tool/measure_tactile_border.py \\
        --dataset ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/local/fold-short-from-flattend-tactile \\
        --episodes 0-5

WHAT IT MEASURES, and why these two statistics. A vision-based tactile sensor's
useful signal is *deformation*: the gel moves when it touches something, so the
pixels that carry information are the ones whose value CHANGES over an episode.
The light leaking in at the boundary does the opposite -- it is bright and it is
temporally flat, because it tracks the room rather than the object. So:

* **temporal standard deviation** per pixel, over the frames sampled. High in
  the gel, low at the housing edge.
* **mean luminance** per pixel. High at the leak, mid-range in the gel.

A row or column is "border" when its temporal variation falls below a fraction
of that profile's own PEAK -- relative, not absolute, because exposure differs
per camera and the four fingertips are not identically lit. The reported
fraction is the largest CENTRED box that excludes every such row and column,
and it is reported per camera so a single bad sensor is visible rather than
averaged away.

MEASURED on `fold-short-from-flattend-tactile`, and it changes how this output
should be read: **the border is a smooth vignette, not a band.** Luminance falls
monotonically from both edges to the middle (0.675 to 0.559 on
`right_arm_right_gripper`, a 21 % rise at the edge) and temporal variation rises
the same way (0.045 to 0.068). There is no sharp boundary to find, so no
threshold at which the answer stops moving -- which is why the report prints a
SENSITIVITY row. Read that row before quoting the headline number: it is where
the judgement lives, and a crop fraction chosen without looking at it is an
opinion wearing a measurement's clothes.

Reports, never writes: the number goes into `So101ActCropConfig.tactile_crop`
by hand, because it is a decision about an experiment and deserves to be made
once and written down.
