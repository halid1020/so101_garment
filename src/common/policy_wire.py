"""The observation/action-chunk wire format shared by the rig and a policy host.

On-robot inference does not have to happen on the robot's computer. The rig
captures the cameras and drives the followers; a machine with a real GPU can run
the forward pass and hand back actions. What makes that cheap is the shape of the
policies themselves: an action-chunking policy consumes an observation only when
it re-plans and then emits many actions at once -- one hundred for the ACT
configuration used here, thirty-two for diffusion -- so a link carries one
observation window per chunk rather than one per control tick.

The format is therefore built around a *window*: the last ``n_obs_steps``
observations, oldest first, because that is the order the policy's own
observation queue expects. ACT asks for one; diffusion asks for two consecutive
frames and would otherwise be fed a pair captured a whole chunk apart, which
never happens during training.

A message is a four-byte big-endian header length, a JSON header, then the
binary payloads back to back. JSON alone would mean base64 for the images (a
third more bytes and a needless copy); a pure binary format would mean a schema
nobody can read while debugging. Images travel as JPEG because raw frames at the
recorded resolution are 2.7 MB per observation, where the three rig cameras
compress to about seventy kilobytes together -- with no effect a policy trained
on lossy video can notice.

Encoding and decoding live together here, and nothing in this module imports
aiohttp or torch, so the format is unit-testable without a GPU, a network or a
robot -- and the client and the server cannot drift apart, because neither owns
a private copy of it.
