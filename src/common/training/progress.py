"""How far a training run has got, read from the only record that exists.

Nothing in this pipeline writes metrics anywhere a program can read them.
``--wandb.enable=false`` is unconditional in ``test/system/long_vla_real.sh``,
this LeRobot ships no ``SummaryWriter``, and no jsonl or csv is produced --
``MetricsTracker.to_dict()`` returns exactly the numbers wanted and is never
called. What there is, is the driver's log, and so that is what this parses.

Two things about that log are not obvious and both are load-bearing.

**The step is abbreviated.** ``format_big_number`` renders steps 10 500 and
10 600 alike as ``10K``, so the ``step:`` field CANNOT be the x-axis of a curve;
above a thousand it is a label, not a number. ``loss``, ``grdn``, ``lr``,
``mem_gb`` and ``smp/s`` are printed at full precision, so only the axis is
affected -- but a plot drawn against ``step:`` would silently pile two thirds of
an 80 000-step run onto eight distinct x-values.

**The two destinations log differently.** tqdm is disabled inside Slurm, so a
CREATE log is clean ``INFO`` lines with no exact step anywhere, while a thanos
or local log is one enormous ``\\r``-separated blob whose progress frames carry
the exact step, the total, the elapsed time and the ETA -- strictly better
information than the line that follows them.

So the step comes from whichever source is present: the tqdm frame immediately
preceding a metric line, else the line's ordinal times ``log_freq``, which is
exact because lerobot logs at ``step % log_freq == 0`` and nowhere else.
``log_freq`` and the run's total are read from the config dump lerobot prints at
the head of its own log, which both destinations have.

Pure. No I/O, no SSH, no aiohttp: which file to read, on which machine, is
``common.training.runs``.

    * the line's ordinal times ``log_freq`` -- exact too, because lerobot logs
      when ``step % log_freq == 0`` and at no other time, which is the only
      source a CREATE log has.

    A RESUMED run breaks both, and does so invisibly: lerobot builds its bar
    with ``total=cfg.steps - step``, so the second attempt's frames count from
    zero again, and its metric lines restart their ordinal too. The log holds
    both attempts one after the other, so the offset a line needs is decided by
    WHERE it is: the step named by the last ``resuming`` marker before it, and
    zero for a line before any. Inferring the offset from the totals instead --
    which is what this did first -- moves the FIRST attempt's points as well,
    because both attempts happen to carry the same total when the target has not
    changed.

    Falls back to the total-difference heuristic when a log was resumed without
    the driver's marker, which is what a resume done by hand looks like.

    The abbreviated ``step:`` field is used for neither; it is only checked, and
