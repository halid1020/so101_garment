"""The machines a training run can be sent to, and the commands that reach them.

A destination is a machine plus the little that differs about running training
on it: whether work is queued through Slurm or started directly, where its
scratch is, and what its GPU has been MEASURED to carry. Everything else -- the
dataset, the manifest, the camera views, ``test/system/long_vla_real.sh`` -- is
identical at both, which is the point: a run that was checked here behaves the
same on either machine.

Nothing here opens a connection or imports aiohttp. What a destination file may
say, which argv that becomes, and what an unreachable machine should tell the
operator are the interesting parts and are unit-tested directly; the routes are
in ``common.web.training_api`` and the CLI is ``tool/train_launch.py``.
