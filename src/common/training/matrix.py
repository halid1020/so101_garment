"""One training run as a row, and every reason it cannot work.

``hpc/runs.tsv`` has always been the run matrix; this is the same file read in
Python, so the console, ``tool/train_launch.py`` and ``hpc/submit_real.sh`` all
agree about what a row means instead of each parsing it their own way.

The point of the module is ``row_refusals``. A row that cannot work should be
refused HERE -- while the operator is still choosing, before a dataset is
copied and long before a GPU is reserved. Every failure this checks for has
actually happened: a camera that the dataset does not have, a pi0.5 run with
more cameras than the base has slots, a batch size that OOMs a particular card,
and a policy the installed LeRobot has never heard of.

Nothing here opens a dataset, a connection or a GPU: it reads an already-loaded
``info.json`` mapping and a destination dict. That is what lets the same rules
run in a unit test, in the terminal and in a web request.
