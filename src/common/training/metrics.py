"""One line format, so a new curve costs one call instead of four edits.

The driver's stdout log is the only metric record this pipeline has --
``--wandb.enable=false`` is unconditional in all five scripts, the pinned
LeRobot ships no ``SummaryWriter``, and nothing writes a jsonl. A number
therefore has to cross three hops before it can be drawn, and each of them was
a closed list: the remote grep in :mod:`common.training.runs` drops what it
does not recognise ON THE FAR SIDE, :mod:`common.training.progress` parses an
enumerated set of lerobot's own field names, and the page named three of them
literally.

So the hops are generic now, and this module is the contract that makes that
safe. A policy, a callback or a tool prints

    so101-metric step=12000 eval/loss=0.0421 eval/psnr_central=31.2

and the value appears as a curve, with no change to the grep, the parser, the
API or the front end. ``test/unit/test_training_metrics.py`` pins that whole
round trip, because a format nobody re-reads is a format that quietly stops
working.

Two rules the format exists to enforce:

**The step is explicit and exact.** It is not taken from ``step:``, which
``format_big_number`` rounds above a thousand (10 500 and 10 600 both print as
``10K``), and not from a line ordinal, which only works because lerobot logs at
one fixed interval. Whoever emits the metric knows the step; they say it.

**The name carries its namespace.** ``train/``, ``eval/`` and ``pred/`` group
the panel grid, so a name without one is refused rather than landing in a
group chosen for it by accident.

Pure: string in, string out. No I/O beyond the ``print`` in :func:`emit`.
