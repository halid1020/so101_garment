"""Which log, on which machine, and how little of it has to travel.

``common.training.progress`` turns a log into a curve. This decides where that
log is, gets it off the machine that holds it, and finds the runs nobody told us
about -- the nine finished directories on CREATE were all started from a
terminal, and a viewer that listed only what the console launched would show an
empty page next to a full drive.

Three things here are deliberate.

**One round trip, not four.** A remote read is a whole SSH, so each question is
one command whose answer carries its own section markers. The log itself is
filtered ON THE FAR SIDE: the live ACT log on thanos is 5.8 MB of tqdm frames
and 723 useful lines, and after the filter it is 190 KB -- roughly constant as
the run grows, because what grows is the part that is dropped.

**The tqdm frame rides along.** After ``\\r`` is translated, a metric line and
the progress frame that precedes it are the SAME line, so grepping for the
metric line brings the exact step with it. Matching progress frames separately
looked equivalent and shipped 1.7 MB instead of 190 KB.

**Standard output only.** CREATE prints an MFA banner and a QR code on stderr at
every login. Anything that falls back to stderr when stdout is empty -- which is
what "no such job" looks like -- renders that banner as a status.
