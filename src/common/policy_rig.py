"""What a rollout drives: the arms on the bench, or the same arms in the twin.

A rollout loop needs remarkably little from a robot -- an observation to send,
somewhere to put an action, and a way to stop safely. Naming that little makes
the digital twin a drop-in for the rig, so a chunking strategy can be measured a
hundred times in simulation and then run on hardware through the same client,
the same wire and the same splice.

    ``observe() -> (state12, {camera: HWC uint8})``
    ``command(action12)``
    ``enable(first_action12)``  -- authorise motion and reach the first goal
    ``shutdown()``
    ``cameras``  -- the names ``observe`` will produce
    ``frames``   -- ``get_rgb_image(name)``, the one thing the live view asks

Two more are OPTIONAL, and a caller must ask whether they are there rather than
assume: ``hold()``, which spends a tick on a rig whose clock only moves when
commanded, and ``reset(scenario)``, which puts a scene back for the next
attempt. Neither exists on the bench -- a bench tick passes whether anyone
commands it, and no button can tidy a real table -- so they are not in the
protocol, and the loop reaches them through ``getattr``.

A DEPLOYMENT needs two things a benchmark does not, so they are in the protocol
rather than in one implementation: ``enable``, which is where torque is turned
on and the arms are ramped to the first action, and ``frames``, which is where
the live view reads its pictures. The twin answers both -- with a ramp that
takes the same three seconds, and a cache of its last render -- so a rehearsal
in simulation walks the same path, in the same order, as the run it rehearses.

The hardware implementation stays in ``tool/run_policy.py``, where the
buses, the torque and the confirmation prompt already live and where they
belong: this module deliberately imports nothing that can move a real motor.
