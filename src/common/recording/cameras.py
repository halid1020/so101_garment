"""Generic UVC (OpenCV) camera capture thread for data collection.

Generalised from the retired single-camera thread (git 185df55^:
src/common/threads/camera_usb.py): one :class:`CameraCapture` per stream, each
opening its own ``/dev/videoN`` device, forcing the configured resolution
(warn-once resize if the device negotiates a different size), converting BGR to
RGB, optionally rotating 180 deg, and publishing into the shared
``DualDataManager`` via ``set_rgb_image(rgb, name)``. On device loss the loop
retries the open every 2 s so a bumped USB cable does not kill the session.

Freshness is a design constraint, not an accident: every stream is opened with a
compressed pixel format (``fourcc``, MJPG by default — several uncompressed
640x480@30 streams do not fit through the shared USB controllers) and with the
shortest driver queue, and the loop is paced by the blocking read alone so no
queue of stale frames can build up. See :meth:`_configure`.

The recorder polls :meth:`seconds_since_last_frame` to detect stale streams.
