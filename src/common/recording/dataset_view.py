"""Camera-ablation VIEWS of a collected dataset.

An ablation asks what a policy loses when a camera is taken away. The honest
way to answer it is to train on the same episodes, the same frames and the same
actions, changing only which cameras the policy can see -- so the datasets that
differ must differ in nothing else.

Copying a dataset per camera set would do that and is wasteful: the videos are
99% of the bytes (525 MB of 543 MB for ``cube-pnp-new``) and they are exactly
the part that is shared. A **view** is a directory that LeRobot opens as an
ordinary dataset while owning almost nothing: the metadata is rewritten to name
only the cameras being kept, and each kept camera's video directory is a
symlink back to the source. A three-camera dataset therefore yields three views
for a few megabytes.

Rewriting the metadata rather than overriding the policy's inputs is what makes
this cheap at training time too. ``LeRobotDatasetMetadata.video_keys`` reads the
feature table in ``meta/info.json``, so a camera that is not named there is
never decoded -- and ``dataset_to_policy_features`` then derives exactly the
inputs the policy should see, with no ``--policy.input_features`` override to
keep in step with the data. MEASURED on this laptop, batch 8 with 4 workers:
127 ms/batch for three cameras, 56 ms for one.

Views also normalise the task string, which matters for one policy and not the
others. ``cube-pnp-new`` carries two spellings of one instruction -- "place it
on the plate" and "place it one the plate" -- because the string was retyped
partway through collection, leaving a minority of episodes labelled with the
typo. ACT and Diffusion ignore language entirely, but pi0.5 is conditioned on
it, and that minority would otherwise teach it a second instruction for one
task. The source dataset is never modified: the correction lives in the view,
where it is one rewritten column.

What a view holds, and why:

  * ``videos/<kept camera>/`` -- a symlink to the source. The bytes are shared.
  * ``meta/`` and ``data/`` -- REAL files, rewritten. They are small (under
    4 MB together here), and both carry per-camera and per-task columns that
    have to agree with ``info.json`` or the dataset describes itself wrongly.
  * ``extra/`` -- absent. The sidecar streams are a recording artefact; nothing
    in training reads them.

Building is atomic and idempotent, because the cluster builds views from
several array tasks at once: each build lands in a temporary directory and is
renamed into place, and a task that loses the race keeps the winner's view.
