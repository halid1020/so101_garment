"""Turning a session's device failures into one honest explanation.

Each device reports its own failure and knows nothing about the others, so a hub
going down surfaces as several unrelated complaints: two cameras that cannot be
reopened, a serial bus that will not write, a storage volume returning I/O
errors. Reported that way it reads as several broken cables, and an operator
acting on it reseats three connectors that were never loose. Reported together it
is one hub, and the remedy is a different socket or a power supply.

The decision is only about what to blame. Several devices failing on one hub is a
hub or power fault, and the message should name the hub and everything behind it
-- including the devices that did not happen to fail, because they are the ones
that will next time. A single device failing, however often, really is that
device, and the cable-and-port advice is right for it.

Pure and unit-tested: the caller supplies what failed and where each device
sits, and gets back the lines to print.
