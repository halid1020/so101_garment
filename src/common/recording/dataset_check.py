"""Is this dataset whole, and if not, what exactly is missing?

A LeRobot dataset counts its episodes in ``meta/info.json`` and stores them in
three parallel places: a row in ``meta/episodes/``, frames in ``data/``, and our
own per-episode side files under ``extra/``. Nothing keeps those in step. A
recording that is counted and then not written -- an episode aborted between the
counter and the files -- leaves a PHANTOM: an index the dataset believes in and
nothing on disk backs.

That is not a cosmetic fault. ``DatasetReader._check_cached_episodes_sufficient``
requires ``set(range(total_episodes))`` to be a subset of the episodes actually
present, so one phantom makes LeRobot judge the whole local copy incomplete,
and ``LeRobotDataset.__init__`` then goes to the Hub for a version tag. Offline
-- which is how this rig runs on purpose -- that surfaces as
``OfflineModeIsEnabled: Cannot reach https://huggingface.co/...``, an error about
a network, for a dataset that never left the drive, raised by every rewrite path
there is: compaction, deletion and merging alike.

So this module reads the dataset the way the dataset itself is written --
parquet and JSON, no LeRobot import -- and can therefore describe one that
LeRobot refuses to open. ``dataset_integrity`` says what is wrong,
``ensure_loadable`` is the guard every rewrite calls first, and
``repair_phantom_episodes`` removes an episode nobody wrote.
