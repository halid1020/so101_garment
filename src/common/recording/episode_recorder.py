"""Episode recorder: the state machine that owns the LeRobot dataset writer.

A single background thread paces at the dataset fps and is the SOLE caller of
``add_frame`` / ``save_episode`` / ``clear_episode_buffer``. Button callbacks
never touch the writer — they only post ``request_start_episode`` /
``request_stop_save`` flags, which the loop consumes.

States: IDLE -> RECORDING -> (SAVING | DISCARDING) -> IDLE, with
RECORDING <-> PAUSED while a camera stream is missing.

Discard triggers while RECORDING:
* shutdown requested (``DualDataManager.is_shutdown_requested``) -> park;
* a thread error inside the loop -> park;
* robot activity became DISABLED -> NO park (a torque-off already happened and
  re-torquing unattended arms is riskier);
* a camera stream absent for longer than ``camera_dead_s`` -> NO park (a data
  problem, not a safety problem).
``park_arms`` (injected) is therefore invoked ONLY for the shutdown/thread-error
triggers.

Camera staleness is graded, because a USB camera that drops off the bus is
usually back within a couple of seconds and throwing away a long, otherwise
good episode for a momentary glitch costs the operator far more than the gap
does. A frame staler than one tick but within ``camera_stale_s`` is reused with
a throttled warning. Beyond ``camera_stale_s`` the recorder PAUSES: it stops
adding frames and holds the episode, then resumes it the moment every stream is
fresh again. Only if the stream stays away for ``camera_dead_s`` is the episode
abandoned.

A pause leaves a real hole in the episode, and it is deliberately NOT hidden:
LeRobot derives each frame's timestamp from its index, so the saved episode
would otherwise claim one tick between the frames either side of a multi-second
gap. Every pause is counted and totalled, and the episode summary says so, so an
operator can review or drop an episode whose gap is too large to train on.

Any automatic end (abandon, disabled arms, shutdown, thread error) plays the
stop cue, because an operator watching the arms rather than the terminal
otherwise cannot tell that recording ended and would keep performing the task.

Each saved episode also gets a timestamp id (``new_episode_uid``) recorded
beside it. The episode index cannot serve as a name: deleting one episode
renumbers every later one, so the same index refers to a different recording
afterwards. The id is fixed when recording starts and never moves.
