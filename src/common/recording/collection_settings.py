"""Read an existing dataset's stream settings and turn a selection into flags.

The friendly collection front-end (``tool/collect_dataset.py``) drives the same
recorder as ``tool/meta_quest_teleopration.py --record``. Two pure helpers back
it, kept dependency-light so they unit-test without a dataset or hardware:

* :func:`read_existing_streams` reads the LeRobotDataset metadata (``meta/
  info.json`` plus the sidecar ``meta/realsense.json``) to recover exactly which
  streams a dataset was collected with, so resuming it follows those settings
  instead of asking again.
* :func:`selection_to_teleop_flags` turns a stream selection into the precise
  ``--enable-camera`` / ``--disable-camera`` / ``--central-depth`` /
  ``--no-record-ee`` / ``--dataset-fps`` flag set the recorder needs, forcing
  the resolved streams to match regardless of ``recording.yaml`` defaults.
