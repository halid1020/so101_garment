"""Curation helpers for a collected LeRobot v3.0 dataset (edit/delete on disk).

Deleting a recorded episode is not a file removal: v3.0 packs several episodes
into shared chunk files, so a real per-episode delete goes through LeRobot's
``delete_episodes`` (it re-encodes any video segment that mixes kept and deleted
episodes and renumbers the survivors 0..M-1). Our own side files under
``extra/`` (per-episode depth directories, sidecar and drift parquet) and the
two dataset-level meta JSONs LeRobot does not know about are re-indexed here with
the same old->new mapping, then swapped in atomically.

Because that rewrite touches the whole dataset, it costs tens of seconds even
for a single episode, which is far too slow to sit behind a click while an
operator reviews a session. Deletion is therefore two steps. Marking is
instant: the reviewer's decision goes into a small marker file
(``extra/soft_deleted.json``) and the marked episodes are hidden from the review
tool immediately. Compaction performs the real rewrite once for the whole batch.

The marked episodes remain on disk until compaction, so anything that CONSUMES a
dataset must treat a non-empty marker as "not ready": training on a dataset with
pending marks would train on the very episodes the reviewer threw away. Use
``read_soft_deleted`` to check.

The pure helpers (``deletion_mapping``, ``extra_reindex_ops``,
``surviving_indices``) are unit-tested; ``delete_episodes_in_place`` and
``compact_dataset`` perform the file operations. Shared by the web review tool
and any other curation entry point so the re-indexing lives once.

    LeRobot keeps a recorded episode in RAM longer than it looks. The metadata

    writer open until the dataset is finalized at exit; the frame-data side keeps
    its own writer open until one file reaches a size limit. So while a session
    runs, ``meta/episodes/`` is empty or footerless and the newest
    ``data/`` file is footerless too -- which is all that a "Parquet magic bytes
    not found in footer" complaint means. A reader cannot list the episodes
    (hence frame counts showing as unknown) and cannot open the dataset at all,
    because reading concatenates every data file and one unfinished file fails
    the lot. Worse, an interrupted collector -- a kill, a power cut, a crash past
    the exit handler -- loses whatever never reached disk, and an episode whose
    metadata or frames never landed is unusable for training even though its
    video is sitting on the drive.

    Each saved episode is therefore committed here, on both sides: close the
    writers so the footers are written, then point the NEXT episode at a fresh
    file. Advancing is required rather than tidy -- LeRobot reopens a writer at
    the path derived from the last episode, which would truncate the file just
    closed and take the earlier episodes with it. For the frame data that means
    handing control back to LeRobot's own "start a new file" branch (the one that
    runs when a dataset is resumed) by clearing its cached last episode and
    seeding ``meta.episodes`` with the row just committed, so the new file's
    indices and frame offsets are computed by LeRobot rather than by us. One
    modest file per episode is exactly the layout resuming already produces, and
    ``read_episode_lengths`` reads such a directory with per-file fault
    isolation.

    Returns ``False`` when the object does not expose the internals this relies
    on (a different LeRobot version, or a stub in tests), so a caller can carry on
