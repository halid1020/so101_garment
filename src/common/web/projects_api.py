"""Routes for the Training tab's projects.

Thin, like ``training_api``: the rules are ``actoris_harena.web.projects`` and are
unit-tested directly. This layer reads a request, keeps the file work off the
event loop, and turns a :class:`ProjectError` into a 400 with the sentence it
carries.

Not in ``ROOT_REQUIRED_PATHS``, deliberately. A project groups runs on other
machines; it has nothing to do with the collection directory, and the reading
half of the Training tab has to work with none chosen -- which is how it is
used from a laptop watching a GPU box.
