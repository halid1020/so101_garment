"""The Training tab: pick a dataset, some policies and a machine, and start.

Thin, deliberately. Which runs are possible, what a `-` becomes and every
reason a row cannot work all live in ``common.training``; staging and
submission live in ``tool/train_launch``. This module reads a request, runs the
blocking parts off the event loop and turns an exception into a status code --
so a run started here is the same run, checked the same way and recorded in the
same file, as one started from the terminal.

Two shapes are borrowed from the rest of the console. Refusals come back at 200
inside the plan, the way ``/api/session/plan`` does, so the page can show them
while the operator is still choosing; and a launch is a ``jobs.py`` record,
because copying a dataset over SSH takes minutes and must outlive the request
that asked for it (``refuse_while_busy`` then also stops it racing a merge).
