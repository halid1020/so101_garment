"""Where a rollout's actions come from: this process, or another machine.

Both sources answer the same small protocol, so a control loop never learns
which one it has:

    ``offer(state, images)``  -- here is this tick's observation
    ``take() -> action | None`` -- give me something to execute, or nothing
    ``drain()`` / ``set_paused(bool)`` / ``depth`` / ``last_sent()``

:class:`LocalActionSource` runs the forward pass inline, exactly as it always
did. :class:`RemoteActionSource` sends the observation window to a GPU host and
splices the returned chunk into what is already queued, following one of the
strategies in :mod:`common.chunking`.

``reset()`` is on the remote source only, and a caller looks for it rather than
assuming it: a second attempt on the same scene needs the host to forget the
session it has been accumulating, and inference in this process has no such
session to begin again.

Neither touches a camera or a servo bus, which is what lets the same client
drive the rig and the digital twin.

    THE SPLICE. A chunk lands after the world has moved on, and ``strategy``

    the reply arrives, because its whole point is that nothing is executed from a
    stale plan. The arms hold still for the round trip.
