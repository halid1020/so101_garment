"""What one autonomous rollout did, written down while it happens.

A failed grasp is over in a second and cannot be paused mid-air, so the run has
to leave enough behind to be examined afterwards: what the policy was shown,
what it planned from that, and what the arms actually did with the plan.

Three files, because they are written at three different rates.
``ticks.parquet`` has one row per control tick -- the measured joints, the goal
written, the mode, the queue depth -- and is what a tracking plot is drawn from.
``chunks.jsonl`` has one line per *plan*, appended the moment it lands, so a run
that dies mid-episode still leaves its plans on disk; a chunk is thirty-two
actions and a state, and the sequence numbers tie it back to the ticks that
executed it. ``trials.jsonl`` has one line per *attempt*, appended when somebody
says how it went: a run is a sequence of attempts at the same rig, and without a
verdict against each trial number a comparison between two checkpoints lives in
somebody's notebook rather than on disk.

Images are not stored by default: they are the largest part of an observation by
far, and the questions this log usually answers are about joints. They are the
one thing an attribution study cannot do without, though -- an attribution needs
the pixels the plan was drawn from -- so ``save_frames`` writes the observation
behind each *chunk* (not each tick: a chunk covers seconds) under
``frames/<seq>/<camera>.jpg``. Off unless asked for. Written by
``tool/run_policy.py``; read by ``common.analysis``.
