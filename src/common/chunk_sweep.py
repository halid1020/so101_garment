"""Which (strategy, hyper-parameter) combinations a chunking sweep should run.

``common.chunking`` says what each splice DOES; this module says which ones are
worth measuring. They are separate because the strategies are not comparable as
bare names: ``receding`` at an execute ratio of 1.0 is a different animal from
``receding`` at 0.25, and a ``blend`` over three ticks answers the seam question
differently from one over ten. A sweep that varies only the name therefore
compares one arbitrary tuning of each strategy against another, and its ranking
is an artefact of the defaults. So a sweep cell here is a strategy TOGETHER with
the numbers it consumes, and the grid is the thing that gets run.

THE BUILT-IN GRID (``expand_grid("all")``) is seventeen cells:

  * ``sync``, ``append``, ``replace`` -- one each; none of them reads a
    parameter, so there is nothing to vary.
  * ``receding`` at execute ratios 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0 -- the whole span
    from "re-observe four times a chunk" to "run the plan out", which is the
    axis that decides whether its blocking is paid for.
  * ``blend`` over windows 3 / 5 / 10 ticks, each with a linear and an
    exponential ramp -- short enough to be a join, long enough to be a
    refusal to act on the new plan, and both shapes of getting there.
  * ``ensemble`` at new-plan weights 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.7 / 0.9 -- from trusting
    what is already queued to nearly discarding it.

``rtc`` IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT. Its smoothing happens inside the denoiser on
the GPU host, so it is only a distinct strategy when the host advertises
``meta["rtc"]``; against a host that does not, the client-side splice is exactly
``replace`` and a row labelled ``rtc`` would be a duplicate of one already in the
grid, wearing a name nobody could trust afterwards. ``tool/policy_server.py``
does not advertise it today. Ask for it explicitly -- ``--grid rtc`` -- once a
host does, and the handshake in ``policy_client`` will refuse if it does not.

THE CUSTOM SPEC is a ``;``-separated list of terms, one term per strategy::

    strategy[:param=v1,v2][:param=v3,v4]

``:`` introduces a parameter, ``,`` separates the values that parameter takes,
and every listed parameter of a term is cartesian-producted with the others. So

    receding:execute_ratio=0.5,1.0;blend:blend_window=5:ramp_kind=linear,exp

is four cells: receding at each of two ratios, and a five-tick blend with each
of two ramps. A term with no parameters (``append``, or ``blend`` on its own)
is one cell carrying that strategy's defaults, so the results table always
states what was actually run rather than leaving it to be guessed.

Parameter names are the ones ``RemoteActionSource.set_strategy`` accepts --
``execute_ratio``, ``blend_window``, ``new_weight``, ``ramp_kind`` -- so a cell
can be splatted straight into it. Naming a parameter a strategy does not read is
an error rather than a no-op: it would silently produce duplicate cells that
differ only in a label, and two identical rows in a comparison table are worse
than a refusal.

Pure: a string in, a list of dicts out. No numpy, no network, no clock.
