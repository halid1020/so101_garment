"""Slide-ready output: videos, plots and tables from an attribution run.

A study is not a talk. What persuades on a slide is a picture that moves in step
with the thing it explains, and a table small enough to read from the back of a
room -- neither of which falls out of ``attribution.json`` unaided.

Everything here reads a finished result. Nothing infers, nothing loads a
checkpoint, so a figure or a video can be redrawn from the numbers without a GPU
and without the dataset.

Videos are encoded with **PyAV**, not the ffmpeg command line: a compute node
has the library and not the binary, which is the same reason
``recording/dataset_view.py`` encodes its composites that way. H.264 rather than
the AV1 the datasets use -- a slide deck is opened by whatever is on the laptop
in the room, and PowerPoint and Keynote both decode H.264 and neither reliably
decodes AV1.
