"""When in an episode a stream mattered, against what the hands were doing.

An attribution averaged over an episode answers almost nothing. Tactile cameras
cannot contribute while the grippers are still travelling towards the cloth, and
that they contribute little THERE says nothing about whether they matter at the
moment of contact. So the interesting figure is contribution against time, with
the episode segmented by what the grippers were doing -- and the segmentation
has to come from the data rather than from a stopwatch.

The gripper channels are the segmentation. They are columns 5 and 11 of the 12-D
action, from the recorder's own layout ``[left5 deg, left_grip, right5 deg,
right_grip]``, and across these datasets they span a few tenths of open fraction
and never reach either end -- so a phase boundary is a change in that narrow
band, never an absolute threshold, which would put every frame in one phase.

Pure: numbers in, labels out. No policy, no torch.

    and on the calibration of the day.

    A frame is *closing* or *opening* when the gripper is moving faster than
    ``move_quantile`` of the speeds at which this episode's gripper actually
    MOVES, and the sign says which. It is *holding* when closed and not moving,
    *reaching* when open before the first close, and *released* when open after
    the last one.

    "Actually moves" is doing real work there. The commanded gripper is held
    constant most of the time, so a quantile over every frame is dominated by
    zeros -- and for an episode whose gripper changes on only 17 % of frames it
