"""What ACT's decoder looked at, per action of the chunk.

ACT is a transformer whose decoder cross-attends from one query per planned
action to the encoder's tokens -- and :mod:`common.analysis.streams` knows which
token belongs to which camera. So the attention weights give something no other
method here can: a *per action step* reading of which stream the policy consulted
when planning action 0, action 50, action 99. That is the shape of a plan's
reliance over its own horizon, for the price of one forward pass.

Getting it costs nothing extra. ``nn.MultiheadAttention`` computes the averaged
weights whether or not they are wanted, and ACT's decoder discards them with a
``[0]``; a plain forward hook picks them back up.

**Attention is not attribution**, and this module will not let itself be read as
if it were. High attention on a token does not establish that the token changed
the output -- the value it carries may be near zero, and a residual path can
route around it entirely. It is reported BESIDE integrated gradients and the
occlusion effect, and where the three disagree that disagreement is the finding.
Only occlusion actually intervenes on the policy; the other two are inferences
about it.

MEASURED on the five-camera ACT checkpoint over 206 frames of six episodes, and
the reason :func:`deviation` exists: this decoder's cross-attention has almost no
DYNAMIC RANGE. Each camera owns 300 of 1 502 tokens, so uniform would give it
0.1997 of the mass -- and the pooled shares run 0.192 to 0.219, a spread of
1.14x across the five, where occlusion over the same frames spans 1.4 % to
57.1 %, a spread of 42x. Pooled, the two rank the cameras alike (+0.90); PER
FRAME they often do not, agreeing at a mean of only +0.17 with 35 % of frames
correlating negatively. So the raw mass is dominated by TOKEN COUNT and is far
too flat to read as importance, however well it happens to sort.

What carries information is the DEVIATION from uniform, and how it varies across
the chunk's own horizon -- `central`'s share runs about 0.31 for the first
actions of a plan and 0.08 for the last, which no token count explains.

Diffusion has no equivalent: it conditions a UNet on a concatenated feature
vector with no attention over cameras at all, which is one of the concrete ways
the two policies must be analysed differently.
