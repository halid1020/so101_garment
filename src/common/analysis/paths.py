"""Where an analysis is written, so two of them can be found and compared.

One rule: **every analysis lands under a directory named for the day it was
run, and a subdirectory named for what it contains.**

::

    outputs/analysis/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<content>/          the numbers and figures
    outputs/analysis/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<content>/slides/   the deck built from them

The date is the answer to the question that was actually being asked of the old
layout -- *is this the current result?* A bare ``outputs/analysis/act-all`` said
nothing about whether it came from this week's code or from a checkpoint two
retrainings ago, and the only way to tell was the file mtimes. Naming the
directory for the day makes a stale deck obvious at a glance and lets a rerun
sit beside its predecessor instead of overwriting it.

``<content>`` is ``<policy>-<camera slug>``: the slug is the one
``recording.dataset_view.view_slug`` already produces for a camera set, so an
analysis directory and the run directory it analysed are named the same way and
can be matched by eye.

``$SO101_OUTPUT_DIR`` is honoured, as everything else in the repo does -- the
analysis tools were the exception and wrote relative to the working directory,
so running one from anywhere but the repo root scattered results.
