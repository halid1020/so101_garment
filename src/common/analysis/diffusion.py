"""What a stochastic multi-step sampler needs that ACT does not.

ACT plans deterministically at eval: its VAE latent is sampled only
``if self.training``, so two identical observations give identical chunks and an
occlusion delta is entirely the perturbation's doing. **A diffusion policy is
not like that**, and by a wide margin. MEASURED on a real checkpoint: two plans
from ONE unchanged observation differ by 32.4 in commanded units, while
occluding the overhead camera entirely moves the plan by 32.5. Attribute without
pinning the sampler and **99 % of what you measure is the sampler**.

The same applies to any flow-matching policy (pi0.5, ``so101_flowmatch``,
``so101_dreamzero``): they integrate from noise too.

**How it is pinned, and why not the obvious way.** The obvious fix is to hand
the policy a fixed starting ``noise`` -- both ``predict_action_chunk`` and
``generate_actions`` accept one. That is not enough, and believing it is leaves
the numbers just as wrong while looking fixed. The scheduler is a
``DDPMScheduler``: it draws FRESH noise at every one of its denoising steps
(``modeling_diffusion.py:265``, the variance term), and only
``conditional_sample`` takes a ``generator`` -- which neither wrapper forwards.
VERIFIED: identical starting noise and identical conditioning still give
different plans.

So the pin has to cover every draw wherever it happens, which means the global
RNG. :func:`pinned` sets it and then **restores the state it found**, so nothing
else in the process observes a jump -- the usual objection to seeding globally,
answered rather than ignored.
