"""One checkpoint, held open, answering "what would you plan from this?".

The seam every method in this package shares. It is deliberately NOT
``common.policy_client``: that one owns a queue, a session and a chunking
strategy because a rollout needs them, whereas an attribution needs one
observation to give one chunk, repeatably, with nothing remembered in between.

``predict_action_chunk`` is what makes that possible -- it returns the whole
plan and touches no queue -- and for ACT it is deterministic: the VAE latent is
sampled only ``if self.training``, so at eval it is zeros and two identical
observations give identical chunks. Diffusion is not; see
:mod:`common.analysis.diffusion`, which pins its starting noise.

Actions come back UNNORMALISED, in the units the arms are commanded in
(degrees, and gripper open fraction), because a per-joint number is meant to be
read. The post-processor unnormalises one step at a time -- handing it a whole
chunk is the obvious thing to try and is wrong -- so a chunk is pushed through
it step by step, exactly as ``tool/policy_server.py`` does.
