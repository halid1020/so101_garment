"""Attribution by differentiating the plan with respect to what produced it.

Occlusion (:mod:`common.analysis.perturb`) answers "does this policy use that
stream" by taking it away. Gradients answer a finer question -- *which pixels*,
and how much each contributed -- and they do it at a resolution occlusion
cannot reach without one forward pass per region.

Three methods, and each is here for a reason the others do not cover.

**Integrated gradients** (Sundararajan, Taly & Yan, 2017) is the primary
quantitative one, because of its completeness axiom: the attributions sum to
``f(x) - f(baseline)``. That is what makes per-stream totals COMPARABLE -- five
cameras' shares are five parts of one whole rather than five unrelated numbers,
which is exactly what a plain gradient cannot give. It is also what makes the
implementation testable: :func:`completeness_error` checks the axiom holds, and
if it does not, the integration path is wrong.

**SmoothGrad** (Smilkov et al., 2017) averages gradients over noised copies of
the input. Plain gradients on a ResNet trunk are too noisy to read as a picture;
this is what makes an overlay legible, and it is offered for looking at, not for
ranking.

**Grad-CAM** (Selvaraju et al., 2016) weights the last convolutional feature map
by the gradient flowing into it. It answers *where in this tactile image*, at
the resolution the network actually reasons at, for the price of one backward
pass. It needs a convolutional trunk, so it runs on ACT and on diffusion but
NOT on a token model: pi0.5 and the flow-matching policies have no feature map
to weight, and integrated gradients is what they get instead. Where the trunk
is, and how many times it runs, differs between the two -- :func:`cam_trunks`.

Hand-rolled on torch autograd rather than pulled from captum: each is a few
dozen lines, and this repo's venv is heavy enough already.

NOTHING HERE IS TRUSTED ON ITS OWN. Saliency methods can be insensitive to the
model entirely -- see :func:`randomise_weights` and the sanity check it exists
for -- and are reported beside the occlusion effect they should agree with.

    The path runs in the NORMALISED tensor space the model actually sees, from

    and normalising each step would follow a different path than the one the
    axiom is stated over, and completeness would then fail for a reason that
    looks like a bug in the integration.

    ``steps`` is the Riemann sum's resolution, and the default was MEASURED
    rather than picked. On the five-camera ACT checkpoint, one real frame, the
    completeness error falls 0.29 (16 steps) -> 0.22 (32) -> 0.15 (64) ->
    0.017 (128) -> 0.008 (256): the axiom holds and this model is simply
    non-linear enough to need a fine path. Over 206 frames of six episodes the
    error at 64 steps averages 0.20 and reaches 0.87 on the worst frame, so it
    varies a great deal with the observation and is worth reading per result
    rather than assuming from that one convergence sweep.

    The per-stream SHARES -- what is actually reported -- converge far sooner
    than the sum does: the largest share moves by 0.0016 between 64 steps and
    128, and by 0.0001 between 128 and 256. So 64 is the default (about 16 s a
    frame on a laptop GPU) and the completeness error is returned with every
    result, so the reader can see how coarse the path was rather than take the
    default on trust. Raise it for a figure that has to carry the axiom.
