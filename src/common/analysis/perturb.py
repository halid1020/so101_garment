"""Take a stream away and see what the policy plans instead.

The behavioural ground truth of this package, and the thing every gradient
method here is scored against. It asks the question directly -- give the policy
the same observation with one camera replaced, and measure how far the plan
moves -- so it needs no assumption about architecture, differentiability or
where a feature lives. What it costs is one forward pass per stream.

TWO DIRECTIONS, and they answer different questions.

*Leave one out* replaces a single stream and keeps the rest. A large effect
means the policy depends on that stream; a SMALL one does not mean it is
unused, only that the others carry the same information. This measures
redundancy, and on a rig with four fingertip cameras there is a lot of it.

*Only one in* replaces every stream but one. A small effect means that stream
alone nearly determines the plan. This measures sufficiency, and it is the half
that catches a camera whose leave-one-out score is near zero purely because its
neighbour says the same thing.

THE BASELINE IS PART OF THE RESULT. There is no neutral image. Zeroing is the
usual choice and is off-manifold -- a policy has never seen a black frame, so
its reaction says as much about surprise as about dependence. Four are offered
and every figure names the one it used; where two baselines disagree about a
stream, that disagreement is the honest answer.
