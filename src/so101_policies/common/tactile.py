"""Crop a vision-based tactile sensor down to the part of it that touches things.

WHY. Grad-CAM on the finished five-camera ACT checkpoint shows the policy
attending to the **edges** of the fingertip images -- `right_arm_right_gripper`
saturates along its left edge and top-right corner while the gel centre stays
cold -- and it does so in frames where nothing is in contact. That is the
signature of light leaking in at the gel boundary, a known failure of
vision-based tactile sensors: the border is bright, it moves with the ambient
light rather than with the object, and a network will happily learn it.

AND WHY IT CROPS ROWS ONLY. Measuring the frames rather than assuming the
obvious shape changed the design. The rim is real -- the outermost lines are
7.4 % to 22.2 % brighter than the frame's dimmest -- but it is a smooth vignette
with no boundary to find, and, more awkwardly, **horizontally the bright rim and
the responsive region are the same pixels**: on two of the four sensors the
columns whose temporal variation is in the top quartile run right to the frame
edge. A centred width crop cannot take the leak without taking signal with it.
Vertically every camera has room to spare. So the default crops height and
leaves width alone, and the numbers behind that are in `DEFAULT_CROP`.

WHAT IT DOES, and the one decision worth arguing about: it crops the central
fraction of each tactile frame and then **resizes back to the source size**.
Resizing back costs a little interpolation blur and buys the thing that makes
this a one-file change instead of a survey:

* ACT's per-camera token count stays 300, so `analysis/streams.py` keeps
  tiling. It assumes every camera contributes the same token width, and
  cropping only the fingertips would break that assumption for the very
  analysis this change is measured by.
* The diffusion encoder sizes its feature dimension from a dummy input at
  construction time; an unchanged input shape cannot disagree with it.
* pi0.5 letterboxes with `resize_with_pad`, so a changed aspect ratio would
  change how much padding each slot gets -- a second, uncontrolled difference
  between the cropped run and its baseline.

WHERE IT RUNS. As a processor step at index 0 of the preprocessor, ahead of
`RenameObservationsProcessorStep`. That ordering is load-bearing on pi0.5,
whose rename map turns `observation.images.left_arm_left_gripper` into
`observation.images.left_wrist_0_rgb` -- run the crop afterwards and it would
look for camera names that no longer exist and silently do nothing. The
preprocessor runs during training as well as inference
(`lerobot_train.py` calls it on every batch), so this changes what the policy is
trained on, not merely what it is shown at deployment.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. Contact gating -- feeding tactile only once contact is
established -- was considered and deliberately left out. "Stable contact" is a
temporal predicate and training shuffles frames, so a processor step sees a
batch and never an episode; the repo's own contact segmentation
(`analysis/phases.py`) needs a whole episode because it thresholds on quantiles
of that episode's own gripper channels. A training-time gate would have to be
re-derived from the tactile image against a no-contact reference, with its own
threshold to justify. That is a separate piece of work, not a flag on this one.
