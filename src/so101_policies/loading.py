"""Loading a checkpoint into whichever implementation you want.

A checkpoint records the policy type it was trained by, in ``config.json``. That
is normally the right answer, and :func:`ensure_registered` is all a loader needs
-- without it, ``get_policy_class("so101_act")`` cannot resolve a name only this
repo defines, and the failure reads as an unknown policy rather than an unimported
package.

:func:`config_as` is for the other case: reading a checkpoint through the OTHER
member of a ported pair. The ports keep the upstream module tree, so the weights
fit either class; only the type string in ``config.json`` differs. That is what
lets the finished ACT checkpoint be replayed through this repo's copy without
retraining it, and what the equivalence test compares.
